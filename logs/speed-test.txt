GT.M Rocks!!!
gpl

I wrote a standalone test driver that will work on any GT.M system. 
( you have to change the calls to $$NOW^XLFDT to another way to get a timestamp..
and then do the number of seconds computation differently...I don't know how)

I'm attaching the mumps routine C0XTEST.m

The first time I ran it I got significantly worse results. Then I realized that I had
generated a random Graph number for each node.... In our triples load all the
Graph numbers are the same... Here's what that first run looked like:

GTM>D EN^C0XTEST

INSERTION STARTS AT 3111105.234543

USING BULKLOAD
LOCKING ZERO NODE
ZERO NODE UNLOCKED, IENS RESERVED=10000
3111105.234543
INSERTION ENDS AT 3111106.000401
 ELAPSED TIME: 1098 SECONDS
 APPROXIMATELY 9 NODES PER SECOND

Second run on gpl (which is a VM) got worse, even though all the Graph pointer are the same.

GTM>D EN^C0XTEST

INSERTION STARTS AT 3111106.0032

USING BULKLOAD
LOCKING ZERO NODE
ZERO NODE UNLOCKED, IENS RESERVED=10000
3111106.0032
INSERTION ENDS AT 3111106.00532
 ELAPSED TIME: 1280 SECONDS
 APPROXIMATELY 7 NODES PER SECOND

I put C0XTEST on raven and I couldn't believe my eyes....

So I upped the anti to 100000 nodes
